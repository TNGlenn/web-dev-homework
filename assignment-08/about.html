    <h2> Why I Chose Painting</h2>

    <p> I chose to teach painting a self portrait because it's something I've
    been working on for a few weeks and I have plenty of in progress shots.<br>

  It's also something I'm passionate about so I knew I wouldn't get tired
of looking at these images while crafting this site.
<br> I think the best way to learn
more about painting is to follow along a tutorial on Youtube or take a class
on a platform like Skillshare. <br>
 In person classes and critiques can be really helpful
but online resources can be less intimidating to beginners. </p>
