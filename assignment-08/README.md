## Assignment 08

1. I think the most difficult thing for me to learn was inserting videos. I had
a lot of problems with embedding videos and forgetting to close things. It always
felt really satisfying when I finally got something to work.

2. I'm excited to learn things that will help me style my websites more so
they aren't so they don't look so 90's Angelfire.

3. I was able to copy a lot of code from past assignments for parts of this
project which helped speed things up a lot.
