## Assignment 12 README

1. It isn't exactly where I want it to be but I saw my client being myself
making a kind of parody website for a joke business where you can hire
people to beat you up.

2. A block is an element with a kind of margin that doesn't allow any
other element to be right next to it. Inline basically just lines the element
up next to another. Meanwhile a blick seperates the element even further.

3. Again I struggled a lot, it's really frustrating feeling like I have this idea or sketch I'm trying to fulfill but I can't get something quite right!
I feel like I am learning though.
