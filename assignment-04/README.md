# Assignment 04
1. I went to old tumblr pages and saw some ancient memes. I even saw Domo. It was magical. The site looks way different now and goes through terrible updates every month and gets sold every two months now so it was really nostalgic.
2. I think this module was fairly easy and I'm really enjoying seeing my code turn up on another page. Usually so far when I mess up I can identify pretty quickly where I went wrong.
