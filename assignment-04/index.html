      <p> I'm Nobody! Who are you? <br>
      Are you-Nobody-too? <br>
      Then there's a pair of us!<br>
      Don't tell! they'd advertise-you know!<br> </p>

      <p> How dreary-to be-Somebody!<br>
      How public-like a Frog- <br>
      To tell one's name-the livelong June-<br>
      To an admiring Bog! </p>
