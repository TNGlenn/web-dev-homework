1. There can only be one head and one body element.
2. Structural markup basically gives structure to a page by dividing it into lists or paragraphs. Semantic markup gives you more information about the page's content.
3. I didn't find most of this assignment very difficult but once I had everything set up I didn't manage my time very well in entering the content. The only actual mistakes I made were easy to fix by checking my website and tweaking things.
