## Assignment 09

1. If I'm understanding things correctly, I think I prefer to use #ids because
they are really specific, but I suppose the other selectors are really useful because
 they can group multiple similar items together.

 2. I made a mistake and picked four colors from an outfit my mom put me in
 when she forced me to participate in a marathon with her in the 90's.

 3. I really struggled and couldn't figure out how to align my image with my text
 and had to facetime my childhood friend who teaches children how to code. It
 was really sad.
