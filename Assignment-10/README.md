1. A web font is a font that is that is available on many operating systems so the fonts
on your website will appear as you imagined them. A system font is the default font
any given operating system uses. A web safe font is a font that is available on
almost all browsers. It also had default "fallbacks" built in, so even if the chosen
font is not available, a similar font will be substituted.

2. It's important to have fallback fonts because viewers of your website might not have
the fontface you have chosen downloaded or available.
