      <p>Hi my name is Ebony Dark’ness Dementia Raven Way and I have long ebony black hair (that’s how I got my name) with purple streaks and red tips that reaches my mid-back and icy blue eyes like limpid tears and a lot of people tell me I look like Amy Lee (AN: if u don’t know who she is get da hell out of here!). I’m not related to Gerard Way but I wish I was because he’s a major fucking hottie. I’m a vampire but my teeth are straight and white. I have pale white skin. I’m also a witch, and I go to a magic school called Hogwarts in England where I’m in the seventh year (I’m seventeen). I’m a goth (in case you couldn’t tell) and I wear mostly black. I love Hot Topic and I buy all my clothes from there. For example today I was wearing a black corset with matching lace around it and a black leather miniskirt, pink fishnets and black combat boots. I was wearing black lipstick, white foundation, black eyeliner and red eye shadow. I was walking outside Hogwarts. It was snowing and raining so there was no sun, which I was very happy about. A lot of preps stared at me. I put up my middle finger at them.</p>

      <p>“Hey Ebony!” shouted a voice. I looked up. It was…. Draco Malfoy!</p>

      <p>“What’s up Draco?” I asked.</p>

      <p>“Nothing.” he said shyly.</p>

      <p>But then, I heard my friends call me and I had to go away.</p>

      <p>XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX666XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX</p>

      <p>The next day I woke up in my bedroom. It was snowing and raining again. I opened the door of my coffin and drank some blood from a bottle I had. My coffin was black ebony and inside it was hot pink velvet with black lace on the ends. I got out of my coffin and took of my giant MCR t-shirt which I used for pajamas. Instead, I put on a black leather dress, a pentagram necklace, combat boots and black fishnets on. I put on four pairs of earrings in my pierced ears, and put my hair in a kind of messy bun.</p>

      <p>My friend, Willow (AN: Raven dis is u!) woke up then and grinned at me. She flipped her long waist-length raven black hair with pink streaks and opened her forest-green eyes. She put on her Marilyn Manson t-shirt with a black mini, fishnets and pointy high-heeled boots. We put on our makeup (black lipstick white foundation and black eyeliner.)</p>

      <p>“OMFG, I saw you talking to Draco Malfoy yesterday!” she said excitedly.</p>

      <p>“Yeah? So?” I said, blushing.</p>

      <p>“Do you like Draco?” she asked as we went out of the Slytherin common room and into the Great Hall.</p>

      <p>“No I so fucking don’t!” I shouted.</p>

      <p>“Yeah right!” she exclaimed. Just then, Draco walked up to me.</p>

      <p>“Hi.” he said.</p>

      <p>“Hi.” I replied flirtily.</p>

      <p>“Guess what.” he said.</p>

      <p>“What?” I asked.</p>

      <p>“Well, Good Charlotte are having a concert in Hogsmeade.” he told me.</p>

      <p>“Oh. My. Fucking. God!” I screamed. I love GC. They are my favorite band, besides MCR.</p>

      <p>“Well…. do you want to go with me?” he asked.</p>

      <p>I gasped.</p>
